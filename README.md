#MySQL Backup to Ceph via S3 â€“ Bash Automation Script
This project provides a Bash script that automates the process of backing up a MySQL database, compressing the backup into a .tar.gz archive, and uploading it to a Ceph Object Gateway using S3-compatible API calls. It's designed for easy integration into cron jobs or other automated workflows for secure and efficient backup management.
